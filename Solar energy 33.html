        <section id="history">
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p> Before 2010, India was one of the countries with the highest rates of carbon impacts. But despite their many efforts, they were unable to make up for their shortcomings. No matter how much they used coal, wind turbines, biomass, hydroelectric power, and nuclear energy, they had a heavy impact on the health of the population and depleted their resources. That's how they came up with the idea of using energy that is less impactful and infinitely renewable. </p>

        <section id="objectives">
            <h2>Objectives</h2>
            <p> 
                <ul>
                    After having listed their needs and their needs, the Indians set themselves the objectives. To this, we can note :
                    <li> Reducing their dependence on fossil fuels </li>
                    <li> Spread electrical energy over the vast territory to avoid load shedding in certain areas</li>
                    <li> Reach 500 GW capacity by the year 2030 </li>
                    <li> The expansion of solar energy, the sector is expected to create a significant number of jobs in manufacturing, installation, and maintenance </li>
                    <li> India is investing in research and development to advance solar technology and energy storage solutions. </li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Advantages</h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    The reason why India chose solar energy is that it has many advantages. To this, we can mention:
                <li> Reduced dependence on fossil fuels</li>
                <li> Energy security</li>
                <li> Rural electrification</li>
                <li> Job creation </li>
                <li> Environmental benefits </li>
                <li> Government initiatives </li>
                <li> International collaboration </li>
                <li> Abundant solar resources </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

        <section id="disadvantages">
            <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    In the same way that there is no such thing as light without shadows, the use of solar energy has many disadvantages or limitations, namely:
                    <li> Intermittency : Dependant on sunlight. </li>
                    <li> High initial costs </li>
                    <li> Maintenance and durability of the solar panels </li>
                    <li> Lands and space requirements </li>
                    <li> Environmental impact </li>
                    <li> Energy storage impact </li>
                    <li> Economic viability </li>
                </ul>
